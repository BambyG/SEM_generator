# SEM_generator

As you might know before getting into Data Science I was a Marketing Manager. An important part of our SEM campaigns was actually to create them, based on a good keyword and ad copy research and brainstorming.

I got this project idea from a datacamp tutorial, I decided to apply it to a company I use quite often: Deliveroo.

I am using BeautifulSoup to extract data from their webpage. The idea here it's not creating the perfect ads because that would have required me to do a proper keyword search, but rather focussing on the technical side of it.

How can I use python to save time on such marketing tasks?

Let's go!
